Conditional Statements: These are the statements that are used to specify a conditional check before the execution of a particular statement.
The conditional statements in programming are:
1. if condition
2. else if condition
3. else condition

if(condition)
{
	this block of code will execute if the condition inside if is satisfied
}
----- in-case condition inside if fails then the else if condition will be checked ----
 
 
else if(condition)
{
 		this block of code will execute if the condition inside else if is satisfied
}
 
----- in-case condition inside else if also fails then the else condition will be executed directly ----
 
else
{
 	this block of code is directly executed if both if and else if fails.
}
