Exception Handling:
			It is the process of handling exceptions by providing suitable messages and handlers.
			Exception handling can be done in 3 ways :
			1. using try and catch block
			2. using throws declaration (ducking of exception)
			3. re-throwing of exception		
			
	Exception handlers  are divided into 2 types:
		1. User Defined Exception Handler
			These are exception handlers that are created by the programmer
			
		2. Default Exception Handler
			These are exception handlers that are created by the developers of Java
